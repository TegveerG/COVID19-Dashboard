# COVID-19 Voila application deployed on Heroku

PS: The COVID-19 data gathered by JHU is now deprecated. An integral CSV file, which showcased all relevant figures for COVID-19 struck countries, for my dashboard is now discontinued on JHU's github. As a result, the current dashboard may not showcase accurate figures and plots. Collecting efficient, sustainable data from a single source, at this point in time, is difficult and I would have hoped that JHU continued gathering data in the earlier manner.
